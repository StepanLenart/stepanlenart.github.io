    <h2>One of his quotes</h2>
    <p1>Everyone out there whose dreams are scaring you, whose dreams make you want to quit, just do not quit. That is good. Your dreams should be big, they should be scary. Just keep pushing through. It is not about winning. It is not about a trophy. It is about having no quit. It is about giving everything you have so that when you show up on game day, before the results are over, you are proud of yourself, and you know the work you put in.</p1>
